# The Future of Harveston - Predicting Nature's Shifts  
_Data Crunch by CodeJam, CSE UOM_

## Overview
In the heart of Harveston, a self-sufficient land of sprawling fields and winding rivers, the people have lived in harmony with nature for generations. Their survival depends on the land’s ability to provide, and every harvest is a delicate balance between natural forces.

Recently, this balance has shifted — rains are unpredictable, sun intensity varies, winds change course, and climate patterns evolve. Farmers can no longer rely solely on tradition; they need data-driven insights.

For over a decade, scholars have documented environmental changes: temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, wind patterns — but measuring units vary across kingdoms. The complexity of this data requires machine learning to unlock predictive insights.

Accurate forecasting will help Harveston's farmers plan planting cycles, allocate resources wisely, and prepare for weather extremes, securing food and economic stability for future generations.

## Objective
Build time series forecasting models to predict shifts in Harveston’s climate by forecasting five key environmental variables for each kingdom in the specified units:

- Average Temperature (°C)  
- Radiation (W/m²)  
- Rain Amount (mm)  
- Wind Speed (km/h)  
- Wind Direction (°)  

Your model should forecast these variables for future dates provided in the test dataset.

## Problem Statement
Develop models that can accurately predict the environmental variables listed above for given future timestamps, assisting Harveston's farmers with actionable insights.
